And it works automatically, so all you have to do is keep doing what you love. Everyone gets 5GB of free iCloud storage to start, and itâ€™s easy to add more at any time. With iCloud Photo Library, you can browse, search, and share all the photos and videos from any of your devices, whether they were taken yesterday or years ago.</p>
